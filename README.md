<h1>Shitty Chess</h1>
<br><h2>Fecici 2025</h2>
<br>
An attempt at a proper chess engine, using bitboards with a standard minimax and eval approach, with the goal of adding techniques like transposition tables, quiescence searches, iterative deepening, and perhaps neural networks for the eval. Written in C99. My first attempt at chess apps used python and it was obviously very, very slow. This project is meant to not do that again.
